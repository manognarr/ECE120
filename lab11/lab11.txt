Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.
One of the errors was that there was an extra comma. Another  was the order of the nzp in the the BRnzp instruction(pz 
instead of zp). One of the lines didn't have an operand(.ORIG) so that caused an error. A recurring error was when the
label was not specified so the PCOffset couldn't be calculated. 


Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 
INPUT: x300E 
NEGATIVE: x3010
ZERO: x300F
RESULT: x3011


Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
Labels are better because they allow for an easier understanding of the code compared to the memory locations
or offsets.
